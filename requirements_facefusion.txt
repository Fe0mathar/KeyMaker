# requirements_facefusion.txt
# Minimal example for LadyInRed / FaceFusion dependencies.

# 1) Core library for your face-swapping/AI processes:
# e.g. "facefusion" is hypothetical if there's a PyPI package or local reference
# facefusion @ git+https://github.com/facefusion/facefusion.git

# 2) A typical web framework if your face-swapping tool runs a local server:
Flask>=2.2.0

# 3) ONNX runtime for inference (CPU version). 
# If you need GPU, you might add onnxruntime-gpu instead:
onnxruntime>=1.13.1

# 4) Other packages that might be used by facefusion/ladyinred:
opencv-python>=4.6
numpy>=1.23
Pillow>=9.1

# 5) If your project uses tqdm for progress bars, or other utilities:
tqdm>=4.64

# 6) If there's any specific face detection library your FaceFusion approach uses:
# e.g. "face_recognition", "insightface", "mediapipe", etc.
# face_recognition>=1.3.0
# mediapipe>=0.9.0
